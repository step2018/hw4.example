# Example Go program for reading graph edges and nodes

Here's an example way of how to read the graph data files in STEP HW4.  To run
simply put `example.go` in the same directory as the `links.txt` and `pages.txt`
files from
[wikipedia_links.zip](https://drive.google.com/a/google.com/uc?id=1HT6OiQgG0wfeC0xulLfuWqq7y4KT4xHW&export=download)
and execute using

```go
go run example.go
```

This takes about 11 seconds to run and 1.3GiB of memory on my machine.
